R_1nJJNMdl6Mn8EqU;After completing the survey, I no longer think the study is regarding a new radio format.  :);fake transcript or research goal
R_33z0RNH2wOnWFTX;Yeah, I believe there is no new radio show, this is just about studying my reaction to the Democrat's atypical views;fake transcript or research goal
R_5NblNOJqSgU3Kav;Could be. Sometimes these studys are looking for a more psychological answer that a political one.;fake transcript or research goal
R_6kGm55xuPlkDvZk;It's possible that the investigators did nt disclose the true purpose of the study but I can't definitively tell.;fake transcript or research goal
R_3rIkhDKZMwjTaiH;may be more about political attitudes and judgments than an actual radio show format;fake transcript or research goal
R_6iWPG8BHIcSEIEe;Not sure if the goal was real, to assess an actual radio show or to get the opinions of prolific workers on Republican and Democrat stereotypes.;fake transcript or research goal
R_3PGDZV4Dcgi7ESw;I don't think this has anything to do with a radio show.;fake transcript or research goal
R_6b1rYEBnAc49IPF;I suspect this really wasn't about a radio show format but rather a way to get my views concerning typical conservatives and liberals. Perhaps also to see how the presented opinions affected my opinons.;fake transcript or research goal
R_5E4ZeIsFVfMFwTI;I suspect that there may not be a radio show at all & that this survey may have been designed to confirm political biases from either side. Regardless of thr fact, I still enjoyed this survey.;fake transcript or research goal
R_7puSA3WEy17p0dC;While I think a radio show like that would be a great idea, I wonder if the purpose of the study is to learn people's views about politics, and to see how people react to the liberal giving a traditionally conservative viewpoint. There weren't many questions I would expect to see if I was really evaluating a radio show. I only started to suspect it wasn't solely about a radio show toward the end of the study.;fake transcript or research goal
R_3QRgqyhT0pHkzMQ;I was not deceived but I believe ai wrote this.;fake transcript or research goal
R_7P87C5DWwxJD4ly;I don't think so, but the transcript could also have just been generated rather that actually answered by 2 people.;fake transcript or research goal
R_53eG5aylUJdNChb;I'm not sure this is a real show, although the transcript sounds fairly realistic.;fake transcript or research goal
R_7j5c5ix4GoubjGh;I'm sure it's not actually a new radio show but scripted for the study.;fake transcript or research goal
R_7QDuVahEGWSqiAO;I believe that it was not a genuine transcript or a real radio show.;fake transcript or research goal
R_7fefK7vK90jFedx;I don't think the responses were necessarily from real people.;fake transcript or research goal
R_6E92LTd3pOAoZ6F;"I think that the ""Show"" was just another way to evaluate the political temperature in the country.";fake transcript or research goal
R_64zQcHM2qctJQqd;I don't think that this was a real radio show transcript;fake transcript or research goal
R_3x2tHndGwScNNuh;I feel like the transcript was fake. ;fake transcript or research goal
R_3ffaLxOAmw876Xy;I'm not sure the transcript was real.;fake transcript or research goal
R_7QasvTxf5tUMKCM;Only because they were so reasonable, Iâ€™m not seeing that in my interactions on the subjects;fake transcript or research goal
R_6sBzabqmIQKuPlj;Yea AI wrote the radio transcript in my opinion.;fake transcript or research goal
R_1T80IPsyf1Lgut3;Maybe it is a BOT conversation;fake transcript or research goal
R_1ahYCjxfbe33gIh;Just the republican agreeing with affirmative action. Most republicans believe in hard work and not giving hand outs to anyone.;fake transcript or research goal
R_34C82HqFepQyGo9;I don't think the transcript was a real conversation. But apart from that, no.;fake transcript or research goal
R_5R49lIeWr3Y2aCB;I'm not sure if these were real people or not.;fake transcript or research goal
R_13TiwUPzQyl8KHv;Just that there is no actual radio show and the transcript was made by AI.;fake transcript or research goal
R_6owkoUrNbkv2rwS;Could it be that the interaction was AI generated?;fake transcript or research goal
R_1sARyc3KQeaElrj;Likely an AI generated conversation;fake transcript or research goal
R_1VUHor3PyzuWmPL;Yes. I'm pretty sure all the transcript was generated by AI.;fake transcript or research goal
R_6rTPsAqF4DAn6Q1;I think some of the responses were AI generated.;fake transcript or research goal
R_5FRhCik8ZXHSqSp;I dont believe this discussion happened between these two people and the radio show is fake. ;fake transcript or research goal
R_52JHt36hgEZzkhi;"Yes I do suspect that. I am wondering if you are measuring how the presentation of the ""transcript"" affects our view of the participants.";fake transcript or research goal
R_5gC948nTXYmADiP;Well, sure, that is ALWAYS possible. It could have all been AI-generated. :-);fake transcript or research goal
R_7mGUxxgl9Ja55Vn;I doubt there is such a show.;fake transcript or research goal
R_5NIZy9Un6Rto4qt;It didn't seem like a genuine exchange of ideas.  ;fake transcript or research goal
R_523Jxlg1LOt9Dzh;I don't think this was taken from an actual radio show, that whole setup was simply a ruse.;fake transcript or research goal
R_7C2xbGFsO1VamTr;perhaps it was actually a chat bot conversations but it seem authentic;fake transcript or research goal
R_1ozKmpcGhpru4fl;I do wonder if they lied about the liberal's comments regarding gun control because as I said those comments seemed off to me.;fake transcript or research goal
R_5doc7Duhvgux88k;yes, some of the mentioned comments would not be heard by a liberal;fake transcript or research goal
R_5gitCkHSJgfra8C;I think the radio show interactions are probably fake and is a hypothetical scenario in order to get information and perceptions about liberals and conservatives from the participants.;fake transcript or research goal
R_52z5SWiuR9cPNDj;the responses felt like AI;fake transcript or research goal
R_5Yrkj6N3zuvrTAw;Possibly, for instnace, the views in this stufy were very sophisticated, I only hear reoublicans talk about immigration, economic political discussion seems very uncommon in my life or in person. I feel the story I read was probably created by AI Artificial intelligence but that's fine if so.;fake transcript or research goal
R_7mKvXbJaySnjTBZ;the show wasnt real?;fake transcript or research goal
R_7uVAaPcRUz4Ss9U;that it wasn't a real radio show;fake transcript or research goal
R_3bKt0KcVIdx5mdU;I assume this radio show is fictional.;fake transcript or research goal
R_1n4ByLCGUENy0iR;Perhaps AI generated.;fake transcript or research goal
R_6Gj6aHlNmiUTM9F;The radio show might be fake.;fake transcript or research goal
R_50SEGjGL1cYotH5;I don't think these are two real people talking to a radio host.;fake transcript or research goal
R_3TfktE2FOEKOdRT;I don't know if that was an actual conversation or one made up to get my feedback. ;fake transcript or research goal
R_8SXpaQm7DKmNIat;The discussion was AI.;fake transcript or research goal
R_57EuvnnBACdzMe3;Possibly. That does happen often enough with these surveys.;maybe
R_6FhrNC7gZs1gDCb;I always assume that's the case in these surveys;maybe

R_6WOsskpWVtGUYTL;Possibly or probably, but I answered honestly anyway.;maybe
R_6r4ZCVWFKEK492N;most studies do;maybe
R_6rGik4ItxchLysb;I've been doing studies long enough to know they are almost never what they claim to be. I don't even think about it anymore, nor do I really care.;maybe
R_7T8A11e7wywZCrn;probably;maybe
R_1iORlLGHelOhXyZ;Not certain.  It often happens in these studies.  ;maybe

R_3QKxbVgNIOFPEuE;Probably.  Most of the studies are deceptive.;maybe

R_6CHzK7IKgz16wIo;Yea I wondered;maybe
R_7pmL8g09HA6s0Hm;Maybe;maybe
R_5EgsKeZVudC5EK1;Not sure;maybe
R_5Bd3rBQhauaZA8p;Possibly, but it also seems plausible ;maybe
R_3D56G9oe1e2pRRf;Maybe. Seems like these participants were screened to target participants holding certain views.;maybe
R_3Nwlm21GTQKaAx7;possibly;maybe
R_5NgqnKkmLyPWH3L;not sure;maybe
R_7TzwjJkizAWTIwf;Possible because I know greed for power causes many to make promises they do not keep or are not capable of doing. The public has a general trust in words spoken in the moment and is wooed by immediate gradification. Its sad but true. Just look at what the Biden Admin is doing right now with closing the open gate right before elections. Its a sad but tried tactic. However, it will not work this time due to Bidens dementia. ;maybe
