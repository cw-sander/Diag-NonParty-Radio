In this study, we showed you a transcript of a radio show. However, this radio show does not really exist. We wrote the transcript to study people’s perceptions of the relationship between party affiliation and polarized political issues. Some participants read transcripts in which the opinions expressed matched stereotypes about the speaker’s category (such as a Democrat or liberal supporting a liberal position), but other participants read transcripts in which the opinions expressed violated stereotypes about the speaker’s category (such as a Republican or conservative supporting a liberal position). We want to test whether participants who are shown opinions that deviate from the category stereotype are less inclined to infer other people's category membership compared to participants who are shown opinions that confirm the category stereotype.



As mentioned in the beginning of the study, your data were collected anonymously and do not contain any personally identifying information. You have the right to withdraw your initial consent now. If you decide to do so, you will not suffer any disadvantages and you will receive full compensation for your participation. Please be aware that if you provide final consent now, we will not be able to identify your data anymore, and thus not be able to delete your anonymized data at a later time point.
